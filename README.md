# Readme Generator

# What is this?
- This is a readme generator built using node.js that will prompt you to answer some questions and give you a template readme.md file for and project you may be working on
- I built this app as part of a requirement for my development certification as well as display of my work for future employers

# Installation
- If you do not have node downloaded on your machine, you will need to download node from https://nodejs.org/en/
